                                      Bridges – If a tooth is lost, it is 
                                      important to replace it with a false (or 
                                      artificial) tooth as soon as possible. 
                                      This will prevent the teeth that are left 
                                      from drifting out o line and causing other 
                                      problems. A bridge can replace one or more 
                                      missing teeth. It is held firmly in place 
                                      by healthy teeth on each side of the 
                                      missing one(s). A bridge cannot be 
                                      removed, it is permanent.<br>

                                      when more than just a few teeth are

                                      to replace missing roots and support 
                                      replacement teeth. The replacement teeth 
                                      may be fixed to the implants, or you may 
                                      be able to take them out yourself. Because

                                      act much like natural teeth. But implants 
                                      are NOT as strong as natural teeth. You

                                      What will it cost?&nbsp;</font></b><br>
                                      In general, bleaching costs less than 
                                      bonding or veneers. Bonding costs a lot 
                                      less than crowns. Crowns used to be the 
                                      only way to make a chipped widely spaced, 
                                      or discoloured teeth look better.&nbsp; 
                                      Cosmetic dental treatments like bleaching, 
                                      bonding or veneers might not be covered by 
                                      your dental plan. You may have to pay the 
                                      costs yourself.<br>

                                      How long will it take?&nbsp;</font></b><br>
                                      Bleaching most often takes a few visits 
                                      before teeth are lightened. Each visit 
                                      lasts about a ½ hour.&nbsp; Bonding is 
                                      quick, in most cases; several teeth can be 
                                      bonded in 1 visit.&nbsp; Veneers take at 
                                      least 2 visits, and sometimes 3. Some of 
                                      these visits might last longer than 
                                      others.<br>

                                      Tobacco, coffee, tea, blueberries, grape 
                                      juice, cherries and red wine can stain 
                                      bleached and bonded teeth, just like they 
                                      stain natural teeth. Veneers do not stain 
                                      as easily, but they can be chipped if you 
                                      are not careful when biting into hard or 
                                      chewy foods.</body></html>
